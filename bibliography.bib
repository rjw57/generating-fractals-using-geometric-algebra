Under the mapping from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^5$ introduced by Hestenes,
which we call the conformal model, certain geometric objects in $\mathbb{R}^3$
(e.g. spheres, lines, circles, etc) may be conveniently represented as blades
in $\mathbb{R}^5$. Furthermore, geometric operations on these objects (e.g.
intersections, rotations, inversions etc.) may be performed efficiently and
intuitively within this space. Due to its intuitive nature, this approach lends
itself to problems where speed of implementation is important or problems where
the complexity quickly leads to large numbers of `special case conditions'
within classical Vector Algebra. A prototype implementation has been created
and this project will describe it along with some of the approaches taken to
reduce the computational complexity required. The possibility of implementation
in hardware will be discussed.

  Using the algebra developed by Clifford (1878) from the work of Gra{\ss}mann (1877) and the mapping introduced by Hestenes \& Sobczyk (1984), which we call the conformal model, certain geometric objects (e.g. spheres, lines, circles, etc) may be conveniently represented as multivectors in a higher dimension space. Furthermore, geometric operations on these objects (e.g. intersections, rotations, inversions etc.) may be performed efficiently and intuitively within this space. Also the model generalizes well to certain non-Euclidean geometries. A prototype implementation of this model has been created and this paper will describe it along with some of the approaches taken to reduce the computational complexity required. The possibility of implementation in hardware will be discussed and example output will be presented.

  month = {September},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {
  This paper presents a method of interpolating between two or more general displacements (rotation and translation). The resulting interpolated path is smooth and possesses a number of desirable properties. It differs from existing algorithms which require factorising the pose into separate rotation and translation components and is derived from an intuitively appealing framework ¿ i.e. a natural extension of the standard interpolation scheme for pure rotations. The mathematical framework used for the derivation is that of geometric algebra. While this paper presents the theory behind the interpolation and its description as a tool, we also outline the possible advantages of using this technique for vision and graphics applications.
